This modification adds the ability to cycle through multiple channel configurations on the 
NI Traktor Z1MK2, similar to the functionality of the Traktor X1MK2. It enables you to pair 
two Z1MK2 controllers, creating a more versatile and familiar mixing layout for seamless 
performance.

In order, the available combinations are;
A - B
C - D
A - C
D - B
C - A
B - D       

This mod also converts the side screens to Deck Information screens. These display similar
information to the X1 MK3.

The information displayed on the side screens includes;
Track Title
